# Memory Optimization

Memory optimization is a critical aspect of working with machine learning models, especially when training or deploying large models. Mithril provides several techniques to optimize memory usage across different backends, allowing you to train larger models and run inference more efficiently.

## Memory Management in Mithril

Mithril's architecture allows for memory optimization at multiple levels:

1. **Logical Model Level**: Optimization of the model structure
2. **Physical Model Level**: Optimization during compilation
3. **Backend Level**: Backend-specific memory optimizations
4. **Training Level**: Optimizations during training workflows

## Identifying Memory Bottlenecks

Before applying memory optimization techniques, it's important to identify where memory is being consumed:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Enable memory tracking during compilation
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=ml.JaxBackend(),
    profile=True  # Enables profiling during execution
)

# Execute the model to gather memory usage data
outputs = compiled_model(inputs)

# View memory statistics
memory_stats = compiled_model.get_profile_stats()
print(memory_stats.memory_usage)
```

## Graph Optimization Techniques

### Pruning Duplicate Connections

Mithril automatically optimizes the computational graph during compilation to eliminate redundant operations:

```python
import mithril as ml

# This will automatically optimize the graph, including pruning duplicate connections
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=ml.TorchBackend()
)
```

### Removing Unused Tensors

Mithril can identify and remove unused tensors from the computation graph:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Enable more aggressive tensor pruning
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    prune_unused=True
)
```

## Memory-Efficient Operations

### In-place Operations

Use in-place operations when possible to reduce memory allocation:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Create a model with in-place operations
class MemoryEfficientModel(ml.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # In-place addition operation
        self.add = ml.Add(inplace=True)
        
    def __call__(self, x, y):
        # y will be modified in-place
        return self.add(x, y)
```

### Reusing Activations

Structure models to reuse activations when possible:

```python
import mithril as ml

class EfficientModel(ml.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shared = ml.Linear(64, 64)
        
    def __call__(self, x):
        # Compute once, use twice
        shared_output = self.shared(x)
        return shared_output + shared_output
```

## Gradient Checkpointing

Gradient checkpointing trades computation for memory by recomputing intermediate activations during backpropagation instead of storing them:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Enable gradient checkpointing during compilation
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    gradient_checkpointing=True,  # Enable checkpointing
    checkpoint_segments=4         # Divide model into 4 segments
)
```

This is particularly effective for deep models with many layers, as it can significantly reduce memory usage at the cost of some additional computation.

## Backend-Specific Optimizations

### JAX Backend

The JAX backend offers several memory optimization features:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Control JAX memory pre-allocation
backend = ml.JaxBackend(
    pre_allocate=False,  # Disable pre-allocation for more dynamic memory usage
    precision="bfloat16"  # Use reduced precision to save memory
)

# Compile with memory-efficient settings
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend
)
```

### PyTorch Backend

The PyTorch backend includes memory-sharing mechanisms for parallel execution:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Use shared memory for parallel execution
backend = ml.TorchBackend(
    device="cuda",
    enable_amp=True  # Automatic mixed precision to save memory
)

compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend
)
```

### GGML Backend

The GGML backend is designed for memory efficiency with context-based allocation:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Configure GGML with limited memory budget
backend = ml.GGMLBackend(
    mem_size=4 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 4GB memory limit
)

# Compile for memory-efficient inference
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    static_inference=True  # Enable static memory allocation
)
```

## Parallelization for Memory Efficiency

### Model Parallelism

When a model is too large to fit in a single device's memory, model parallelism can be used:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Create a device mesh for model parallelism
backend = ml.JaxBackend(device_mesh=(2, 1))  # 2-device model parallelism

# Compile with model-parallel settings
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    parallelism="model"  # Specify model parallelism
)
```

See [Model Parallelism](model-parallelism.md) for more details.

### Activation Offloading

For very large models, you can offload activations to CPU memory:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Configure backend with activation offloading
backend = ml.TorchBackend(
    device="cuda",
    offload_activations=True  # Move activations to CPU when not in use
)

compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend
)
```

## Memory Optimization During Training

### Batch Size Adjustment

Adjust batch size based on available memory:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Start with small batch size
batch_size = 16
max_batch_size = 128
compiled_model = ml.compile(model=model, backend=backend)

# Gradually increase batch size until memory error
while batch_size <= max_batch_size:
    try:
        # Training with current batch size
        train_loader = create_data_loader(batch_size=batch_size)
        train(compiled_model, train_loader)
        batch_size *= 2  # Try larger batch size
    except ml.OutOfMemoryError:
        # Revert to last working batch size
        batch_size //= 2
        break
```

### Mixed Precision Training

Use mixed precision to reduce memory usage during training:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Configure backend with mixed precision
backend = ml.TorchBackend(
    device="cuda",
    enable_amp=True  # Enable automatic mixed precision
)

# Compile model for training
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    training=True
)

# Train with mixed precision
trainer = ml.Trainer(compiled_model)
trainer.train(train_loader)
```

## Memory Optimization for Inference

### Quantization

Reduce memory usage during inference using quantization:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Quantize model for inference
backend = ml.GGMLBackend(quantize="int8")  # 8-bit quantization

# Compile for efficient inference
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    inference=True,  # Inference-only mode
    static_shapes=True  # Use static shapes for optimization
)
```

### Static Inference

Enable static inference for more efficient memory usage:

```python
import mithril as ml

# Configure for static inference
backend = ml.JaxBackend()

# Compile with static inference enabled
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model=model,
    backend=backend,
    static_inference=True,  # Enable static memory allocation
    inference=True  # Inference-only mode
)
```

## Best Practices for Memory Optimization

1. **Start small and scale up**: Begin with small models and inputs to establish a baseline
2. **Measure memory usage**: Regularly monitor memory consumption to identify bottlenecks
3. **Use appropriate precision**: Choose lower precision (e.g., float16) when model quality is not affected
4. **Leverage parallelism**: Use model parallelism for memory-bound workloads
5. **Consider compilation options**: Experiment with different compilation settings to find the optimal configuration
6. **Backend selection**: Different backends have different memory characteristics - choose the most efficient for your use case
7. **Use gradient checkpointing**: For deep models, enable gradient checkpointing to save memory during training
8. **Batch size tuning**: Find the optimal batch size for your specific model and hardware

## Conclusion

Memory optimization in Mithril involves a combination of techniques across different levels of the framework. By understanding and applying these optimizations, you can efficiently train and deploy larger models on your available hardware.

Remember that memory optimization often involves trade-offs with computational speed. The optimal approach depends on your specific constraints and requirements.
