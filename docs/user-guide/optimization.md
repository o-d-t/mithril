# Optimization

This guide explains the optimization techniques used in Mithril during model compilation and execution.

## Overview

Optimization in Mithril occurs at multiple levels:

1. **Graph-level optimization**: Optimizing the model graph structure
2. **Computation-level optimization**: Optimizing individual operations
3. **Memory-level optimization**: Optimizing memory usage
4. **Backend-specific optimization**: Leveraging backend-specific features

These optimizations are applied during the compilation phase to improve both inference and training performance.

## Graph-level Optimization

### Operator Fusion

Mithril automatically fuses compatible operations to reduce overhead:

```python
# Before fusion:
model |= Linear(dimension=64)(input="input", output="hidden")
model += Relu()(input="hidden", output="hidden_act")

# After compilation, these may be fused into a single operation
```

Benefits of operator fusion:
- Reduced memory transfers
- Fewer kernel launches
- Better cache utilization

### Dead Code Elimination

Operations that don't contribute to the output are automatically removed:

```python
# If "unused" is never used for outputs or other computations, it will be eliminated
model |= Linear(dimension=64)(input="input", output="unused")
model += Linear(dimension=32)(input="input", output="output")
```

### Common Subexpression Elimination

Repeated computation patterns are identified and computed once:

```python
# Both branches use the same computation
model |= Linear(dimension=64)(input="input", output="hidden")
model += Linear(dimension=32)(input="hidden", output="output1")
model += Linear(dimension=32)(input="hidden", output="output2")
```

## Computation-level Optimization

### Operation Specialization

Operations are specialized based on known shapes and types:

```python
# General matrix multiplication vs. specialized version
# If one dimension is known to be 1, a more efficient vector operation might be used
```

### Parallelization

Operations are automatically parallelized when possible:

```python
# Embarrassingly parallel operations (e.g., element-wise operations)
# are distributed across available compute units
```

### Kernel Selection

The most efficient implementation is selected based on input characteristics:

```python
# For small matrices, a simple implementation might be faster
# For large matrices, a tiled algorithm might be used
# For specific shapes, specialized implementations may exist
```

## Memory-level Optimization

### In-place Operations

When possible, operations are performed in-place to avoid memory allocation:

```python
# Operations like activation functions often don't need to allocate new memory
# model += Relu(in_place=True)(input="hidden", output="hidden")
```

### Memory Planning

Mithril analyzes tensor lifetimes to reuse memory:

```python
# Tensors with non-overlapping lifetimes can share the same memory
# This is handled automatically during compilation
```

### Memory Formats

Tensors are stored in optimal memory formats for each backend:

```python
# Row-major vs. column-major storage depending on access patterns
# Packed representations for sparse tensors
# Channel-last vs. channel-first for convolutional operations
```

## Backend-specific Optimization

### JAX Backend

For the JAX backend, Mithril leverages:
- Just-in-time (JIT) compilation
- Automatic vectorization (vmap)
- Device-specific optimizations (TPU/GPU)

```python
# JAX specializes code for input shapes and types
# XLA compiler performs fusion and other optimizations
```

### PyTorch Backend

For the PyTorch backend, Mithril uses:
- TorchScript when possible
- Automatic mixed precision (AMP)
- Device-specific kernels

```python
# TorchScript provides optimizations like fusion and specialization
```

### Other Backends

Each backend has specific optimizations:
- MLX: Metal Performance Shaders for Apple Silicon
- NumPy: Vectorized operations and BLAS/LAPACK
- C/GGML: Low-level optimizations, SIMD, and cache-aware algorithms

## Controlling Optimization

### Optimization Levels

You can control the optimization level during compilation:

```python
# Higher levels apply more aggressive optimizations
compiled_model = ml.compile(model, backend, optimization_level="high")
```

Available optimization levels:
- `"none"`: No optimizations (useful for debugging)
- `"low"`: Basic optimizations only
- `"medium"`: Default optimization level
- `"high"`: Aggressive optimizations (may increase compilation time)

### Disabling Specific Optimizations

You can disable specific optimizations if needed:

```python
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model, 
    backend, 
    optimizations={
        "fusion": False,  # Disable operator fusion
        "memory_planning": True,  # Enable memory planning
    }
)
```

### Optimization Hints

You can provide hints to the optimizer:

```python
# Specify expected input shapes for better optimization
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model, 
    backend, 
    hints={
        "input_batch_size_range": (1, 32),  # Expected batch size range
        "inference_priority": "latency",    # Optimize for low latency
    }
)
```

## Performance Profiling

### Analyzing Compilation

To analyze the compilation process:

```python
compiled_model = ml.compile(model, backend, verbose=True)
# This will print information about the optimization steps
```

### Runtime Profiling

To profile the execution:

```python
with ml.profile() as prof:
    outputs = compiled_model.evaluate(inputs)

print(prof.summary())
# This shows timing information for each operation
```

## Best Practices

1. **Provide shape information** when possible for better optimization
   ```python
   compiled_model = ml.compile(model, backend, shapes={"input": [32, 784]})
   ```

2. **Use in-place operations** where appropriate
   ```python
   model += Relu(in_place=True)(input="hidden", output="hidden")
   ```

3. **Batch operations** for better hardware utilization
   ```python
   # Process data in batches rather than one sample at a time
   ```

4. **Reuse compiled models** instead of recompiling
   ```python
   # Compilation is expensive, so cache compiled models when possible
   ```

5. **Consider memory constraints** when designing models
   ```python
   # Smaller intermediate sizes reduce memory usage
   ```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Custom Optimization Passes

Advanced users can define custom optimization passes:

```python
def my_optimization_pass(graph):
    # Modify the graph to implement custom optimizations
    return modified_graph

compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model, 
    backend, 
    custom_passes=[my_optimization_pass]
)
```

### Hardware-specific Optimizations

For specific hardware targets, additional optimizations may be available:

```python
# For TPUs
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model, 
    JaxBackend(), 
    target_hardware="tpu",
    tpu_options={"precision": "bfloat16"}
)

# For CPUs
compiled_model = ml.compile(
    model, 
    backend, 
    target_hardware="cpu",
    cpu_options={"num_threads": 4, "vectorize": True}
)
```
